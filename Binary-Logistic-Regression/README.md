# Binary Logistic Regression

**Dataset preparation:**
1. Use the diabetes dataset.
2. Randomly Split the dataset into Training (70%), Validation (15%) and Test (15%) sets.

**Problem:**
- Calculate validation accuracy (val_acc) for lr = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001 (max_iter = 500)
- Make a table with 2 columns: learning rate lr and val_acc
- Now, take the lr with maximum val_acc
- Calculate test accuracy for max_iter = 500 and the chosen lr in the previous step
- Plot the train_loss (history) vs epoch (iteration) graph

**Instruction:**
- Do not use libraries such as: "Sklearn", or "pandas".
