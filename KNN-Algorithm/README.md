# K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Algorithm

Generate 100 RGB values at random to create a data-set to (use to calculate)/(train) KNN algorithm on.

Group them on the base colours Red, Green, Blue. Assign  group based on which RGB value is greater. 

R = Red, G = Green,  B = Blue.

Example:  Test: R = 100, G = 80, B = 10 ; Output: the tested pixel (100, 80, 10) is Red.
